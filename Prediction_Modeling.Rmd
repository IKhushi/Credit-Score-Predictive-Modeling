The measurements from red wine,white wine
```{r}
library(gtools)
df_red=read.csv(file.choose("C:/Users/Govind/winequality-red.csv"),sep = ";")
df_white=read.csv(file.choose("C:/Users/Govind/winequality-white.csv"),sep = ";")
wines <- smartbind(df_red,df_white)
head(wines)
```
* Then we'll see the summary:
```{r}
summary(wines)
```
**Distribution of Quality Scores**
```{r}
ggplot(wines) +
 geom_bar(aes(x = factor(quality), fill = type),
 position = 'dodge') +
 xlab('Quality') + ylab('Frequency')
```
